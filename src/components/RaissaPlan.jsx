// Create a new Registration Component on a new route /register and a button in the navbar to get there.
// In this Registration Component, create a Controlled Form with:
// Name - Required, at least 2 chars
// Surname - Required, at least 3 chars
// Email - Required - Should be an email field
// Password - Required - Should contain at least 8 chars, 1 digit, 1 letter
// PasswordConfirm - Required - Should be equal than Password
// All the messages / errors should be displayed properly on the page
// The submit button from the form should be "enabled" (=> not disabled)
// only when the form is validated and when each input's constraints are fulfilled.
// When clicked it should display a recap of the information submitted 
// (you can choose between mounting a component for it dynamically in the same route or redirecting the user to a new route).
